#Overview
This project showcases the power of ensemble learning in regression using three powerful algorithms: RandomForestRegressor 🌳, AdaBoostRegressor 🚀, and GradientBoostingRegressor 📈. These models are implemented to predict house prices based on several informations.

Models Used
🌳 RandomForestRegressor: Utilizes an ensemble of decision trees for robust and accurate predictions.

🚀 AdaBoostRegressor: Boosts the performance of weak learners to create a strong predictive model.

📈 GradientBoostingRegressor: Builds a strong predictive model by combining the strengths of weak learners sequentially.

Results
Compare the performance of each model and identify the best one for your specific regression task. 

The winner in this case was GradientBoostingRegressor 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
